Vera is a .NET package that converts textual content to speech, utilizing Google AI (Gemini) for text generation and internet-based information retrieval.

The original library was written in TypeScript ([GTTS](https://github.com/Stawa/GTTS)), and I'm now migrating the project to C# and .NET to make it faster and more efficient.

## üì¶ Installation

To install the Vera package, you can use the NuGet package manager or install it directly from GitHub. Here are three methods:

1. Using the .NET CLI:
   Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   dotnet add package Vera
   ```

2. Using the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio:
   Execute this command:

   ```
   Install-Package Vera
   ```

3. Installing from GitHub:
   You can also install the latest version directly from the GitHub repository:

   ```
   dotnet add package Vera --version 1.0.0 --source https://nuget.pkg.github.com/Stawa/index.json
   ```

   Note: Replace '1.0.0' with the latest version number available on the GitHub repository.

After installation, you can start using Vera in your .NET projects by adding the appropriate using statements.

## üöÄ Usage

Here's an example of using Vera to generate a response from the Gemini API:

```csharp
using Vera;
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        string apiKey = "GEMINI_API_KEY";
        var gemini = new Gemini(apiKey, Gemini.GeminiModel.Gemini15FlashLatest);

        try
        {
            string prompt = "Explain the concept of artificial intelligence in simple terms.";

            Console.WriteLine("Sending prompt to Gemini API...");
            string response = await gemini.FetchResponseAsync(prompt);

            Console.WriteLine("Response from Gemini:");
            Console.WriteLine(response);
        }
        catch (GeminiApiException ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Error occurred: {ex.Message}");
            if (ex.InnerException != null)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Inner exception: {ex.InnerException.Message}");
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Unexpected error: {ex.Message}");
        }
    }
}
```

In the future, I plan to create Vera Visual as an expansion of the V.E.R.A project. This function displays text for voice input and output on a small LCD screen, improving the system's user interface and interaction possibilities. Vera Visual seeks for a more accessible and user-friendly experience by combining visual feedback with vocal interactions.
